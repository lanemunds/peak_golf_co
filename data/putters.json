This is great for golfers that want a little more feedback about how their putter is moving and can help with controlling pace on ultra-slick putts. Their original Lie Angle Balanced putter, DF 2.1, is quite large and has a high-MOI. That combination makes it feel like it’s gliding on rails. Some golfers want this fully-automatic experience, while others prefer to have a little more control and that’s what MEZZ.1 delivers. P.S. For maximum feedback, check out B.2. It’s not as forgiving as MEZZ.1 or DF 2.1 on off-center hits, but if you’re going to play a blade like B.2 you probably don’t miss the sweet spot much."

The face-balanced design of this putter also works well with players who have little rotation in their stroke or a tendency to push putts.

The OMOI achieved its new stability by taking a view of the entire club – balancing out the increased headweight with a lighter weight grip and shaft to shift the club’s CG and help control face rotation through the putting stroke. Every putter also comes with an additional weight kit – including a pair of 3g and 13g weights interchangeable with the 8g fitted as standard."
